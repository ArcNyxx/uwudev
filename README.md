# uwurandom-in-userspace
`/dev/urandom` is made out of cold hard math.

[`/dev/uwurandom`](https://github.com/valadaptive/uwurandom) generates data through a tiny catgirl furiously typing away utter nonsense inside your computer.

uwurandom-in-userspace also does that, except in userspace. You can now use that catgirl's nonsense in situations where you can't install kernel modules, like in a container!
